# Instructions

- you will need to create a SECRET in a .env file for the dotenv package
- npm install all packages
- Sequelize DB set-up:
    - create a postgres database with the name of your project
    - run `sequelize init` and adjust your config.json
    - run `sequelize db:migrate` to use the structure of the User model
    - develop!
- Other notes:
    - I have included Bootstrap in my fork
    - I have also used a Bootstrap theme and set up a static assets folder to demonstrate how to stylize this project
